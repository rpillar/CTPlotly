# CTPlotly
A implementation of an interface to the Plotly graphing library using Pharo.

This is an initial attempt at creating a Plotly interface and is very much in its initial stages. The primary motivation is that Plotly is _free_ - unlike Highcharts - and therefore can be used without restriction on non-commercial and commericial websites. The code borrows a great deal from the HighchartsSt library.
